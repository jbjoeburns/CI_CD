What is CI-CD

Stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.

Set of practices that make up a pipeline used as a strategy for automated software delivery.

    Source
    Build
    Test
    Produce

Continuous Integration is the process of continuously and quickly commit small changes and putting these through automatic build/test processes.

    This helps avoid the inevitable merge conflicts when committing large numbers of changes

Continuous Delivery is the goal of having a releasable and usable version you can deploy on demand.

    The deployment is done manually.

Continuous DeploymentDelivery is the idea that all changes that go into production is automatically tested, and deployed to customers with no human intervention.

    Failed tests prevent deployment however.

Why use CI-CD

    Increases speed of software release
        Results in greater customer satisfaction as product delivered faster
    Easier to isolate bugs as the small changes iterative approach allows you to narrow down in which version change the bug first appeared, and then isolate the change causing the issue
